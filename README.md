## Project Proposal

> What Game Have I Chosen?

	The game I’ve decided to go with for this project is “Friday Night Funkin’: Hypnos’s Lullaby”, a 2D, cartoon style rhythm game made by members of the community as a mod to the original game simply known as “Friday Night Funkin”. This mod is based around the theme of Pokémon, but doesn’t follow its light-hearted and kid friendly nature. It instead uses disturbing imagery and sound design, warping many familiar faces from the Pokémon franchise into creepy, demonic looking beings who harbour ill intent towards the player. As is the original game, this mod is also a rhythm game that shares many similarities to other video games in this category, namely the Dance Dance Revolution series. In time with the music, the player will need to match the arrows on screen with the correct arrow keys on their keyboard as they try and complete the song without their health dropping to zero.

Why Did I Choose This Game?

	Aside from the very pleasing artwork and catchy musical scores found within the game, “Hypnos’s Lullaby” holds a very special place in my heart as it introduced many new and refreshing gameplay elements to the series, making it one of the hardest mods to master. The tone is also a lot more sinister and intriguing than that of the original “Friday Night Funkin”, which caught my attention. Finally, as a musician myself, music is always something that I love in games and in real life. I am currently working on my very own project which involves the creation of a rhythm game, very heavily based on this series, as well as composing my own scores in a similar style to the music found in this game. As such, I thought it would be only fitting to do this project on “Hypnos’s Lullaby” as it may help me in the future when I start coding my game.

Game Scenario

		For this project, I will be focussing on the gameplay of a specific song. “Monochrome”, composed by Adam McHummus, it is the third and final song in the second level of the mod where the player faces Gold. Gold is the user’s character in the first section of Silver, the game's second level. After dying at the end of the song “Frostbite”, he comes back as a corpse, possessed by an unknown force, having lost all his limbs, his eyes and covered in his own blood, now turned black from decay. I’ve chosen this score as it has one of the most challenging mechanics in the mod and is widely considered by many to be the hardest section of the entire game. “Monochrome” stands to be, to this day, the only song I personally have not completed in Hypnos’s Lullaby even after over 100 separate tries. This is because of the song's main mechanic. During many of Gold’s sections, text will appear on the screen, written in a very cryptic and hard to read font. The player must be able to decode the message and type it into the game before Gold finishes singing. If the user fails to do so, gold disappears into the darkness and the player is forced to start the song all over again. What makes this especially hard is the fact that there are over 50 different random message combinations and, since the mod was cancelled right before release, special characters such as exclamation points and interrogation points are simply impossible to input as this feature was never coded into the game. With this monstrous gameplay mechanics, the creators also implemented jump scares which will queue at set times during the score, obscuring the screen for a moment. Finally, a dead Pokémon appears three times throughout the song, each time, reducing the player’s max HP by 20%. “Monochrome” is one of the few two-phase songs in this mod, where, in the middle of the song, Gold says “No More”, two small red eyes then appear from inside his skull, visible through his empty eye sockets, followed by the unknown force taking possession of his head and tearing it off his torso, his spine going with it. From this point one, the chart becomes significantly more difficult and jump scares happen much more frequently.
